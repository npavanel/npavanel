- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicholas Pavanel! I finished a Bachelor of Science at the University of Toronto in 2021 with a Specialist in Physics and Astronomy and a Minor in Mathematics. My undergraduate thesis in computational astronomy is where I really began to love and enjoy programming. I'm always looking to learn something new, and am a firm believer that anyone can teach you something. 
- 👀 I’m interested in various astronomical phenomenon like dark matter and gamma ray bursts, and more generally in producing predictions from data.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying machine learning with Octave so that I can make predictions from increasingly complex data sets that contain numerous features. I am also always trying to improve my modularity in my programming.
- 💞️ I recently read about a cool idea: do gravitational waves propagate through black holes? If they don't, is a diffraction pattern produced in the gravitational wave?
